#File handling in Python refers to working with files—opening, reading, writing, and
 #closing them using built-in functions. 
#open()-opens a file
#p=open(r'path')// writing r gives no issues
#p.read()//reads the file
#here are some modes and their description.
#'r'-reads//file must exist
#'w'-write//creates file or overwrites.
#'a'-appends//adds to the end of file
#'x'-creates a new file, fails if it exists.
